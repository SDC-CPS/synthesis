# SDCWorks

Discrete manufacturing systems are complex cyber-physical systems (CPS) and
their availability, performance, and quality have a big impact on the economy.
Smart manufacturing promises to improve these aspects. One key approach that is
being pursued in this context is the creation of centralized software-defined
control (SDC) architectures and strategies that use diverse sensors and data
sources to make manufacturing more adaptive, resilient, and programmable. This
rpeository presents SDCWorks, a modeling and simulation framework for SDC. It
consists of the semantic structures for creating models described in the
research paper and an open source implementation of a discrete event simulator
for SDCWorks models. The paper provides the semantics of such a manufacturing 
system in terms of a discrete transition system which sets up the platform for 
future research in a new class of problems in formal verification, synthesis, 
and monitoring.  

The repository is divide into three directories: [examples](examples/) contains
a few examples on help getting started; [paper](paper/) contains the paper
submitted to ICCPS 2017; and lastly, [src](src/) contains all the source code
for the implement simulator. More information on running the program can be found 
in the [src](src/) directory.
