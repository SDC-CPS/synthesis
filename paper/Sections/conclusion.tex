\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec::concl}

Future manufacturing systems will be composed of complex
software and manufacturing plants that work in close coordination 
with each other. They will have to deal with failure, changing requirements,
security threats, \etc Hence, a system that has a {\em global} view
of the overall system will be invaluable for managing such systems. The
\mfname presented in this paper provides a mechanism for modeling and analysis of such systems. 
We envision that  it will engender a new set of research problems in 
 synthesis, verification, monitoring, fault-tolerance targeting 
 manufacturing and more general software-defined control systems. 
%  and build fault-tolerance mechanisms as well as
%security protocols in a seamless fashion. Manufacturing systems of the future
%will hence, be better managed, more efficient and agile.
