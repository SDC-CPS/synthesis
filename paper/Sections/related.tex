Synthesis for routers
- Synthesis for SDN/network updates~\cite{McClurg:2015PLDI}. Main problem solved here is the avoidance of 2-phase updates.
Key differentiator: data packets are mutable, i.e., packet headers can be used for routing. 

- Arvind's work

Synthesis for traffic lights~\cite{coogan2017formal}.
Temporal logic.

Lots of work on program synthesis and synthesis of controllers for mobile robots. These are probably less related.


Formal verification of DES model of manufacturing system~\cite{ZhangKLMA13}.
