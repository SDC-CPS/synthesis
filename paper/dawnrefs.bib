The objective of this paper is to present how to detect the pose of a mobile manipulator under the condition that several ways of grasping are given to the robot. Motion errors and object position errors are considered to detect robot pose in our method because these affect the grasp motion of the robot hand. Coping with these errors, we will propose an effective pose searching method for a mobile manipulator from numerous pose candidates. The performance of the proposed method is illustrated by simulation and experiment.},

@article{Brost88:ijrr,
	Abstract = {
               This paper presents an algorithm for automatic planning of robot grasping motions that are insensitive to bounded uncer tainties in the object's location. The algorithm plans parallel- jaw grasping motions for arbitrary two-dimensional polygo nal objects, which need not be of uniform density. Grasping motions are viewed as parameterized operations, where the parameter values that describe an individual operation define an operation space of all possible operations. By combining an analysis of object geometry and the physics of friction, the planning algorithm divides the operation space into regions, where all operations within a given region produce the same final grasping configuration. Task uncertainties are then included by shrinking these regions by the amount of uncer tainty present. The smaller regions that remain after shrink ing indicate all those operations that will successfully result in a given grasping configuration, even if the worst-case combination of errors occurs.
            
               Moreover, the grasping operations presented in this paper intrinsically reduce task uncertainty. If an operation is cho sen from a region and executed, then two degrees of uncer tainty will be removed from the object's position when the operation is completed.
            
               It is shown that simple squeeze-grasp operations are not sufficient for grasping all possible objects, and offset-grasp and push-grasp operations are added to increase the scope of the planner. The planner has been implemented, and the resulting program has been tested with an industrial manipu lator.

@article{CSI11:vision,
	Abstract = {Two of the important capabilities needed for scene understanding are extracting the gist of the scene and identifying salient regions in the image. Here we present a robotic vision system that utilizes these two modules to understand its surrounding from an image. That is, we would like the robot to be able to localize and navigate in its environment. We present a vision-based navigation and localization system using the two biologically-inspired scene understanding models. For localization, gist, which captures the holistic characteristics and layout of an image, coarsely localize the robot to within the general vicinity. Then, saliency, which emulates the visual attention of primates, refine the location information by recognizing the detected conspicuous regions in the image.For the vision navigation sub-system, we use the gist features to identify the road region. Here, the image is segmented into multiple regions, which are then classified using the gist features to find most likely road region. By incorporating knowledge about the road geometry, the system is able to locate the center of the road as well as avoid obstacles. At the same time, we also use the recognized salient regions to prime the location of the road in the image. Furthermore these regions provides high level navigation parameters such as distance to the junction and overall heading of the road (Chang et al., 2010). The navigation system then uses the estimated road parameters to perform visual feedback control to direct the robot's heading and to go to a user-provided goal location.We test the vision localization and navigation system at four sites (one indoor and three outdoor environments) using our mobile robot, Beobot 2.0. The system is able to keep robot in the center of the lane with a route length over 138.27 m.},

@article{Khatib86,
	Abstract = {
               This paper presents a unique real-time obstacle avoidance approach for manipulators and mobile robots based on the artificial potential field concept. Collision avoidance, tradi tionally considered a high level planning problem, can be effectively distributed between different levels of control, al lowing real-time robot operations in a complex environment. This method has been extended to moving obstacles by using a time-varying artificial patential field. We have applied this obstacle avoidance scheme to robot arm mechanisms and have used a new approach to the general problem of real-time manipulator control. We reformulated the manipulator con trol problem as direct control of manipulator motion in oper ational space---the space in which the task is originally described---rather than as control of the task's corresponding joint space motion obtained only after geometric and kine matic transformation. Outside the obstacles' regions of influ ence, we caused the end effector to move in a straight line with an upper speed limit. The artificial potential field ap proach has been extended to collision avoidance for all ma nipulator links. In addition, a joint space artificial potential field is used to satisfy the manipulator internal joint con straints. This method has been implemented in the COSMOS system for a PUMA 560 robot. Real-time collision avoidance demonstrations on moving obstacles have been performed by using visual sensing.

	Abstract = { Tooling configuration deeply affects the 
    performance of Integrated Manufacturing Systems both in terms of 
    flexibility and productivity. The literature on tooling 
    configuration is extremely scarce and due to the lack of formal 
    methods oversizing is a common practice which leads to high 
    investments in tools. The paper presents a method for tooling 
    configuration that is aimed at tool investment minimization under 
    the constraint of a given system productivity. The method is 
    applicable to real case situation involving hundreds of different 
    tool types. The paper reports on the performance of the method under 
    a set of cases based on a real system. },

@article{bj96:cirp,
	Abstract = { Mutations of the context: economy, society, 
    technology; call for continuous changes of products and related 
    processes. Industry response must range from strategic to tactic 
    horizons. The growing importance of environment and social aspects 
    has lead to the emergence of the life cycle concept and to 
    Sustainable Industrial Production. The Products-Processes life cycle 
    matrix must then change to respond to mutations of the context. It 
    may follow a stepwise path combining innovation (new generations) 
    and evolution (within a generation). An appropriate system is 
    required: the Virtual Factory. It produces' and maintains' new 
    generations. The combination of a Virtual Factory and a Physical 
    Factory, is the Self-Innovating Factory (SIF). Because of 
    products-process complexity, networks, made up of physical 
    factories', are emerging. To respond to context changes, 
    appropriate, Virtual Factories networks should be implemented. The 
    integration of both networks would lead to the Self-Innovating 
    Extended Factory (SEIF), capable of responding to context changes, 
    as required by Sustainable Production Paradigm. The model described 
    has been named MANUFUTURING. The main phases to implement and some 
    of the methods and tools to support it, have been described. The 
    model has been adopted by an industrial group to develop its next 
    generation of manufacturing systems. },

    the semantics of Petri nets (PN) models used to represent and design 
    the algorithms of logic controllers.  In particular, it is 
    investigated how the performance and the correctness of a logic 
    controller algorithm are affected by the particular way in which a 
    PN scheme is converted into an algorithm running on a programmable 
    logic controller.  The model of the logic controller is briefly 
    recalled and the considered execution policies are illustrated. 
    Several subnets are studied, then some solutions are proposed to the 
    highlighted problems.  Finally, an example is considered.},

    called elementary control tasks, linked together through a limited

    maneuvers) and the synchronous execution (shared resources modeling 
    or shared operations). The purpose of the paper is to enlarge the 
    set of theoretical tools previously developed for the incremental 
    approach to the liveness analysis of a net, to be incorporated into

    the choice of the initial marking and the analysis of reachability

    is discussed for both untimed and timed models, and for models both 
    with and without deadlock avoidance control policies. Different 
    control algorithms, among the most common in the literature, have 
    been considered. Imperfect deadlock avoidance control policies are 
    also considered. In addition, some indices are proposed to assess 
    the structural properties of FMS with respect to deadlock occurrence 
    and their performance. Two different application examples are 
    analyzed, with the help of a commercial simulation package. Finally,

	Abstract = {
Deadlock is a major problem for systems that allocate resources in real time. The key issue in deadlock avoidance is whether or not there exists a sequence of resource allocations that completes all processes. This work investigates the complexity of safe resource allocation for a class of systems relevant in automated manufacturing. For this class, the resource needs of each process are expressed as a well-defined sequence. Each request is for a single unit of a single resource and is accompanied by a promise to release the previously allocated resource. Manufacturing researchers have generally accepted that safety is computationally hard, and numerous suboptimal deadlock avoidance solutions have been proposed for this class. Recent results, however, indicate that safety is often computationally easy. The objective of this article is to settle this question by formally establishing the NP-completeness of safety for this class and investigating the boundary between the hard and easy cases. We discuss several special structures that lead to computationally tractable safety characteristics. },
