abstract = "This paper reviews and classifies literature on the use of discrete event simulation for manufacturing system design and operation problems. Simulation has been a widely used tool for manufacturing system design and analysis for more than 30 years. During this period, simulation has proven to be an extremely useful analysis tool, and many hundreds of articles, papers, books, and conferences have focused directly on the topic. This paper presents a classification of a subset of these publications and the research and applications that underlie these publications. "

abstract = "This paper reports the results of a review of simulation applications published within peer-reviewed literature between 1997 and 2006 to provide an up-to-date picture of the role of simulation techniques within manufacturing and business. The review is characterised by three factors: wide coverage, broad scope of the simulation techniques, and a focus on real-world applications. A structured methodology was followed to narrow down the search from around 20,000 papers to 281. Results include interesting trends and patterns. For instance, although discrete event simulation is the most popular technique, it has lower stakeholder engagement than other techniques, such as system dynamics or gaming. This is highly correlated with modelling lead time and purpose. Considering application areas, modelling is mostly used in scheduling. Finally, this review shows an increasing interest in hybrid modelling as an approach to cope with complex enterprise-wide systems. "

abstract = "To survive the cut-throat competition in the manufacturing industry, many companies have introduced digital manufacturing technology. Digital manufacturing technology not only shortens the product development cycle times but also improves the precision of engineering simulation. However, building the virtual objects needed for a digital manufacturing environment requires skilled human resources; it is also costly and time-consuming. A high precision environment with the similar resources is also needed for a high precision simulation. In this paper, we propose a method of constructing a mixed reality-based digital manufacturing environment. The method integrates real objects, such as real images, with the virtual objects of a virtual manufacturing system. This type of integration minimizes the cost of implementing virtual objects and enhances the user's sense of reality. We studied several methods and derived a general framework for the system. Finally, we developed our idea into a virtual factory layout planning system. To assign the pose and position of real objects in virtual space, we applied a circle-based tracking method which uses a safety sign instead of the planar-square-shaped marker generally used for registration. Furthermore, we developed the framework to encapsulate simulation data from legacy data and process data for visualization based on mixed reality. "
