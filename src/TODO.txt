-- Program the simulator.py function
---- simulate: accepts a conveyance graph, requirements, and simulation strategy
     and simulates system for a set time (this could be infinite until stopped
     by user)
---- Add widget tracking capabilities to Connection class (conveyors)
---- Add widget queues, in-progress capabilities to Cell class
---- Allow simulation time to be user defined

-- Connection
---- update: updates widgets on the connection
---- Create variable for speed/velocity

-- Cell
---- send_widget: Function to send a widget to a specific connection
---- update: updates widgets in the cell, cell queue, and status of the cell

-- Conveyance graph functions
---- Fix the check_requirement_feasibilities function to allow checking for more
     than just unidirectional graphs (this may be ok for now)
